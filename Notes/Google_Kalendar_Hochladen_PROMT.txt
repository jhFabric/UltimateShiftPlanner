So I need another script for my python program. 
It is part of a greater modular tool that retrieves information about shifts and availabilities for my company and its employees and exports the intermediate data in CSV files. 
First of all the file and folder structure is very important. 
For the sake of creating an .exe file with pyinstaller later on I do work with a relative_paths function. 
'''
def resource_path(relative_path):
    """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller """
    base_path = getattr(sys, '_MEIPASS', os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    return os.path.join(base_path, relative_path)
'''
The file-structure of the program is: 

'''
Main Directory = .../UltimateShiftPlanner/

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/
UltimateShiftPlanner.py #Welcome Script that calls the other ones. 
readme.md

.../UltimateShiftPanner/output
# here the formattet output files shall be stored

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/tmp
# in this dir there are many .csv files that should be taken into account for the script we want to create. 
holo_shifts.csv
laser_shifts.csv
jonas_events.csv
...

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/resources/

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/resources/source

# here all the scripts called in the Welcome Script are located
shiftplanner.py
Retrieve_Shifts.py
employees.py
formatter.py
upload_events.py # the script we are about to create

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/resources/keys
# Here is the auth-json for the Google Calendar located

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/resources/data
employees.csv
# some more files not relevant for the new script

.../UltimateShiftPlanner/resources/logo
logo.ico

'''

Now the new script should read four .csv files and store the data. 
Firstly in the folder ".../UltimateShiftPlanner/tmp" there are 'laser_shift.csv' and 'holo_shift.csv'. Secondly in the folder ".../UltimateShiftPlanner/input" there are 'laser_{name_of_the_month}.csv' and 'holo_{name_of_the_month}.csv'. {name_of_the_month} does usually conern the current month. To be precise we firstly may analyze "holo_shifts.csv" and "laser_shifts.csv" where the first index (index 0) from the second line onwards contains a date.

For simplicity I will not refer to the .csv files as a datastructure with index(0 - n) but as tables with rows (1 - n) and columns (1 - n). Please notice that in any csv file the first line contains the titles for the columns only. 

Now the files are both structured almost identically. 
The titles in both cases/ all four files are ''' day (YYYY-MM-DD), weekday (e.g. monday), start (start-time of the shift), end (end time of the shift), shift (name of the shift) '''. The last column (shift) is different though. For "holo_shifts.csv" and "laser_shifts.csv" it contains the name of the initial shift. For 'laser_{name_of_the_month}.csv' and 'holo_{name_of_the_month}.csv' it stores the name of the employee that is assigned to that shift. 

Now the script should connect to two google calendars with the IDs : "Holo_Calendar: mcisnbiilvaj5481i9cnloga40@group.calendar.google.com " and "Laser_Calendar: mcisnbiilvaj5481i9cnloga40@group.calendar.google.com "o1l0or1r8bhuhjf6jr8t784tnc@group.calendar.google.com". 
My Oauth Json file is stored in   ".../UltimateShiftPlanner/resources/keys" and is named:" ultimate-shift-planning-a1f509220989.json "
